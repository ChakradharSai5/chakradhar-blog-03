Theory:
1. When you get a good or bad feeling,
 from any action/incident, and you realize that, from logical 
perspective or for any reason, that the feeling that you are getting 
is bad, then ask, realize the fact that, that feeling is coming through a
belief system.
2. So if you want to change that feeling, do not attack directly that feeling,
 that only gives frustration, because you cannot do that,
3. Instead find the belief system causing you that feeling, and see if any fault in belief 
system.
