ACTION PLAN:
1. This SynchThing software accessing "Vault-1" of laptop, so  only that gets synched with label: "Folder of Asus Laptop Obs. Vault-1"
2. Laptop has "Vault-1" in "Obsidian-All-Vaults" folder - so that if required new vault can be made as "Vault-2" or any other name in "Obsidian-All-Vaults" folder
3. In Tablet folder created as "Vault-1-of-Tablet" inside ""Obsidian-of-Tablet", and that is being synched with SynchThing with label: "Folder of s7+ Tablet Obs. Vault-1"
4. In Phone folder created as "Vault-1-of-Phone" inside "Obsidian-of-Phone", and that is being synched with SynchThing to cloud label: "Folder of S22+ Phone Obs. Vault-1"
5. Another vault created in Tablet as "Vault-2-of-Tablet" inside "Obsidian-of-Tablet" is being synched with cloud label: "Folder of S7+ Tablet Obs. Vault-2"
6. This "Obsidian Vault-2 of Tablet" gets synch with "Vault-2" of "Obsidian-All-Vaults" in laptop, and send and receive setting is kept in such fashion
    that changes made in tablet shown in laptop's Vault-2, but changes made in "Vault-2" will not get affected in Tablet's Vault-2 so that this will let me cut
    file in vault-2 of laptop to paste it in Vault-1 and still original files in tablets shall not get affected.

OUR INTENTION:
1. Is to have synch system in such a way, that I will be writing in KMS of obsidian in my laptop,
    that should be easily accessible to phone and tablet's respective obsidain app,
        and by mistake if any changes/deletion made in phone or tablet, that should NOT affect original source file in laptop
        and files in phone and laptop should revert back to original source file
2. And for some of systems, I may want to draw/write in tablet,(as difficult to do in laptop), and that should be available
laptop's main obsidian.
