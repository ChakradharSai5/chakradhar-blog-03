2. Any category/folder/heading name should be INTUITIVE, just by reading, one should be able to get 
a rough idea of what topic related notes shall be present in it

3. Any category/folder/heading name should be EXCLUSIVE, just by seeing a notes file,
one should be able to predict what category it should be placed into, without getting
confused whether to place it in this or that, Same goes around, say I want to find a note
file, I should, just by scrolling in the category/folder/heading list I should be able to 
intuitively feel in which I can find that particular note file

4. We basically have two types of broad way of categorizing knowledge, base on the 
TOPIC IT REFERS TO or FROM WHICH SOURCE IT IS COMING FROM, It is quite important
to try best to give weightage to TOPIC wise, and place it so. Source placing of a file should
be as minimized, if suppose placed in source category/folder/heading, then if required, it may
be linked to topic based note. Mostly links can be used for this purpose only.
