- Currently only HVDC 1000 in service
- For Talcher meramundali current, shall be seen that loading based on that, if HVDC pole block trips, if both this pole block trips and Talcher Meramundali current also should cross the limit that is set by State/Central Govt which is varied seasonally
- From Rourkela, usually we always import, because Rourkela goes to ER2, Rourkela don't have high power flow restriction
- Rengali belongs to SR
