- If `HP mean rotor temperature` is above 360DegC then it will be **HOT**
	- but if it falls below 360DegC once then it has to reach 360+70,(430)DegC above before rolling, if it does then it is **HOT**
	- If it does not reach 430DegC before rolling, then it is **WARM**
- if ~ falls below 160DegC, then **COLD**
- If ~ falls to between 360 and 160DegC, then **WARM**
	- but if decreases to below to 160DegC, then it has to increase to 160+80 (240)DegC before rolling only then **WARM**
	- if it doesn't increase to 240DegC, then **COLD**
