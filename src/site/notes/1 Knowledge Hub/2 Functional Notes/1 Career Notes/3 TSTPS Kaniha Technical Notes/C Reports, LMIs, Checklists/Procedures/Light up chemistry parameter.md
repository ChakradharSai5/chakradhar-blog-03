1. After checking the sample from separator drain and with chemistry clearance AA/AN valves to hot well to be opened and increase feed water flow to 200TPH Clearance Parameters: Sample: Separator Drain 
	1. **pH: 9.2-9.6, Turb: <3ntu, Silica: <100ppb, Crud: <500ppb** 
2. After chemistry clearance, increase the feedwater flow from 200TPH to 600TPH through ANB/AA/AN Clearance Parameters: Sample:
	1. **Feed Water pH: 9.2-9.6, Turb: <1ntu, Silica: <50ppb, Crud: <100ppb** 
3. After achievement of chemical parameters, boiler light up to be done. Clearance Parameters: Sample:
