### ESP Pass isolation
- ESP gates closed, 
- Fields shall be made by operator if you ask him to from switchgear or ESP field control room
- Hopper evacuation should be started
- manual rapping done for around 30 mins
- after emptying all hoppers 
- still air charging done, and checked healthiness of ESP fields
- Then electrical operator goes and for 20 fields that are there, for each module in switchgear he made off, and removes fuses for all the modules
- And operator goes to ESP field control room, where for each field, the panel on or off isolator shall be there, where it is made off, and from the side of the panel, we will remove a key called Earthing key, this earthing key shall be taken for all the 20 ESP fields
- And those 20 ESP fields earthing key shall be taken to rectiformers, and on each rectiformer, this earthing key shall be placed and rotated, to make the contact take away the contact from source to earthing, and then another key is removed
- Fields and ACP, all heaters electrical isolation done, including earthing of rectiformers
- O/L Gates 10% made open and gates also electrical isolation done and that to be made open for cooling, for the whole night, and may be in the morning, we can close it upon request from BMD

### ESP Pass normalization
- ACP breaker normalized, and closed the breaker #pending 
- So ACP charged, shaft and support heaters made on 
- And left 8 Hrs., usually shaft heaters made on evening shift end, and left like that till morning shift start
- evacuation may be started here #pending 
- then pass earthing normalized and fields normalized, but not charged
- with still inlet outlet gets closed, if 10% open, electrical normalization to be done and close, and then still air charging shall be done
- defects in that still air charging noted down
- then inlet and outlet gates opened, after that
- complete charging of fields done
