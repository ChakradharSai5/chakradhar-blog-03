- Fire hydrant line charging 

After PTW cancellation, hydrant line charged, till then hydrant line is completely unavailable 

That is, sprinkler side interconnection manual valve also kept closedand electrical sprinkler was in service with around 10ksc pressure(I think not sure) 

Diesel sprinkler taken I/s, slowly increased pressure from 4 ksc to around 10ksc, as sprinkler side pressure maintaining around 10ksc, later after that interconnection valve opened and then sprinkler pump stopped
