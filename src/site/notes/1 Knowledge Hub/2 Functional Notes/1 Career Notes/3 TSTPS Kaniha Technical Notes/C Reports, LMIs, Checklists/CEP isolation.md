- During [[CEP\|CEP]] isolation, if isolation don't happen properly that is if it is still coming under vacuum, then even if the drainis opened, water willnot come through drain
	- That happens if the suction line or evacuation line passing 
- and suppose if draining happens that is water comes out of drain, but say it is not stopping, that means gland seal water line is passing. as gland seal will seal the suction from vacuum but water goes to pump
