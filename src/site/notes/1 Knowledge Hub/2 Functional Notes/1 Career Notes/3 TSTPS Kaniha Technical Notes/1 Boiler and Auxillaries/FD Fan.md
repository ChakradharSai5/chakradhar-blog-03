- For air measurement the transmitters that are shown in DCS as LHS and RHS are at around 48Mtr a duct going side of the boiler![WhatsApp Image 2025-04-21 at 16.47.33_acde9f98.jpg](/img/user/Obsidian%20Functional%20Stuff/z-All%20pdfs,%20Images%20&%20Small%20Excalidraws/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-04-21%20at%2016.47.33_acde9f98.jpg)
- In this image, that person is standing on the duct, and the impulse line he is welding is taking tapping for air for measuring Air flow going to a LIE panel somewhere, due to leakage of this impulse line, one day, we started noticing difference in air flow, between LHS and RHS flow transmitters, and later it was found that this LHS/RHS i don't remember exactly, impulse line found to have air leakage
