the setup you see here is at MOP , so I guess, bearing 1, right side part is main TG shaft, and the circesl kind of thing you see in top pic is the overspeed bolts that get lifted at 110% and 112% #pending, the two pipe thing on left side one will have two inner circle thing from centre one 110% oil comes and other 112% oil comes from outer circle and so this will go to right side shaft kind of thing and corresponding overspeed bolts gets lifted

And the two drains you see from the right side one are that corresponding bolts drains i guess

In the top pic, on the switchyard side of overspeed bolts you see two mechanisms that will actually gets lifted when the overspeed bolts gets lifted as the shaft keeps rotating, and at the bottom there will be spring cushioned thing that will keep it holded (that you cannot see in the pic)

And in the top pic , at the right most end you see a gear system, which corresponds to gear connected to MOP, Main oil pump, and this whole thing is Main oil tank
