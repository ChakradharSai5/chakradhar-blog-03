- It is confirmed that Main TG has 110% and 112% , 3330rpm & 3360rpm two bolts mechanical overspeed bolts in Stage-1, while doing overspeed test, after checking 110%, for doing 112% we will do in channel-2 which will actually trip the turbine, for the first case we will see if that 110% will lift the bolt or not
