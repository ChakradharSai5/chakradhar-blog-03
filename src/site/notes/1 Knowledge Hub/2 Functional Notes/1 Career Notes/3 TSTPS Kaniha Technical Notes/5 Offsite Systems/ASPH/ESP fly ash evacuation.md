Steps to take Fly ash in to service
- Wetting header valve to be made open 
- Vacuum pump seal water open from
					1. Fly ash pump discharge
					2. Clarified water
					3. Service water
- Vacuum pump to be started
- Vacuum breaker to be closed
- then line vacuum gets build
### Fly ash notes
- Line vacuum should be > 140
- Vacuum breaker open limit is 520
- Shut off vacuum should be 450
- Shut off vacuum in Dry mode should be 300
### Modes of Evacuation
There is one common valve for all 4 lines any single pass, and there is also a valve that is individual valve also
#### Mode 1
- Only with Vacuum pump-1, all 4 lines,
- 
#### Mode 2
- Only with Vacuum pump-2, all 4 lines
#### Mode 3
- Both vacuum pumps shall be running
- this mode creates more vacuum, hence, when we get more ALH hoppers, we keep in this mode, as vacuum maintaing high, help in clearing the ALH of hoppers
- 
#### Mode 4
- Both vacuum pumps in service for different lines
- that is for Vacuum pump-1 for line-1 & 2
- and for Vacuum pump-2 for line-3 & 4

#### Silo All
- if you select his mode, all lines in any single passes in dry mode
- That is for every pass this option shall be available, which makes, if this selection is made, all four lines of any pass shall run in complete dry mode that is new dry ash system
- refer [[1 Knowledge Hub/2 Functional Notes/1 Career Notes/3 TSTPS Kaniha Technical Notes/B Schemes and Drawings made by me/ESP Fields Scheme Drawing.excalidraw\|ESP Fields Scheme Drawing.excalidraw]] for better understanding
- 
#### Silo 2 by 2
- This option shall make two lines Dry & two line Wet, this mode is available in unit-1 Pass A & Unit-2 Pass-D only, because, this mode takes old dry ash in to service
- Hence selecting this, shall make half of evacuation in old dry ash and other half in wet mode, NOT the new dry ash, for new dry ash you got to select other modes

#### Sile 2 line
- For Pass A & C : 3 & 4 lines in dry mode -New dry ash
			 : 1 & 2 lines in Wet mode
- For Pass B & D : 1 & 2 lines in dry mode - New dry ash
			 : 3 & 4 lines in Dry mode
