- To start any series, there all many permissive, some are following, 
	- Suction valve in open
	- Seal water in charge condition [[#Seal Water]]

### Seal Water

- For pump-1 we have LP seal water pumps A& B, 
	- Main source from clarified & Secondary from Firewater
- For pump-2 & 3 we have HP seal water pumps A & B
	- Main source from Clarified & Secondary from Firewater
- For pump-4 we have HP seal water pumps 2A & 2B
	- Main source from Service water & Secondary from firewater


### Procedure to Start
- Scoop kept in minimum position 30%, only for one pump-1
- Start pump-1 all other taken automatic start every 60 sec
- Normally Suction valve in open condition, that is when a series available, suction valve kept open
	- Discharge valve opens in auto with/after of pump-1
- Usually if sump level goes below 40, Series will be taken in service
	- Alarm at sump level < 30
- normally Fluid coupling at 45 & GB oil level at 40%

### Isolation
- Suction and Discharge valve air line isolation
- Seal water isolation
- FC pump - start and stop from local will be in pump running condition #Doubt, only in PTW Fluid coupling pump shall be stopped & GB oil pump will be stopped
### Filling
- Suction kept closed, (which is normally open)
- Discharge kept open
- Flushing water pump manual valve to be made open and Flushing water pump started
- With **No series pump running**
- Here Flushing water pump initially takes about 80-85A, and later after filling completion it may go to 65-70Amp
- It takes about 40mins for complete filling up to ash pond
### Flushing
- Suction kept closed, 
- Discharge made open, 
- Flushing manual valve made open and Flushing water pump start
- Series pump also to be started
### Hydrocoupling and GB oil pump of pump-1
- Hydrocoupling pump of pump-1 have a oil cooling, which gets cooled by LP seal water header, and the hot water goes back to sump
- Gear box oil pump also there for pump-1, which also has same mechanism, where the hot water goes back to sump
- GB oil pump cooler is the one that is vertical
- HC oil pump cooler is the one with that is horizontal
### Permissive
- LP seal water pressure > 4ksc
- HP seal water pressure for pump-2 > 8ksc
						- pump-3 >10-12ksc
						- pump-4 > 16-18ksc
