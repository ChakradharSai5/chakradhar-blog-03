- the loading SOV shall pass oil to compressor some hydraulic unit, which shall make the compressor to laod, probably by motor coupling with compressor unit
- So this oil that passes oil through it shall go to loader, which shall then load the compressor
- recently, there is compressor not getting loaded, after multiple trial and error attempts, they came to know that it is the Loader issue, as it is not sending out oil in the pressure it is suppose to.
