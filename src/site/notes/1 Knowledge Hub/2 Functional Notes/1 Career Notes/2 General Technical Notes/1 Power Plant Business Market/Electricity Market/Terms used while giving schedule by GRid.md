### GNA (General Network Access)
- entities (power generators, distribution companies, etc.) have fair and long-term access to the **transmission network** 
- helps avoid **overloading** the transmission network and ensures long-term grid reliability.
### TGNA (Temporary General Network Access)
- Provides **short-term access** to the **transmission system** for a limited period, for various reasons, such as meeting unexpected power demand or for short-term generation surpluses.
Basically these above both are restrictions from transmission network, probably PGCIL shall be involved in this

### REMC (Renewable Energy Management Centre)
- Purpose: 
	- specialized control centers integrate renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, monitoring renewable energy generation in **real-time** and help forecast, schedule, and balance the variable nature of renewable power.
Basically Renewable energy shall be restriction end of this
### PX (Power Exchange)
- Market platform where electricity trading, real time
### SCUC (Security Constrained Unit Commitment)
- used to determine the most cost-effective way to commit power generation
- **Longer-term planning** of which generation units should be **committed (turned on or off)** over a period of time (typically **day-ahead or longer**), ensuring both economic efficiency
- **longer-term horizon** (day-ahead or several hours)
### URS (Un-Requisitioned Surplus)
- surplus power generation capacity, not requisitioned by any state or distribution company from the allocated power plants. Generators can sell this surplus power in the market
### SCED (Security Constrained Economic Dispatch)
- **Real-time dispatch** of generation to meet demand economically
- **short-term basis** (minutes to hours)
