- During Ramp up of unit light up time, our EEMG guy sudhanshu sir logic is if our DC revision it self is from block to block is less than 1% ramp, then though we declare 1% ramp eligible block for this period, doesn't mater, because any way our SG is going to get capped at DC, so no way we are actually going to get 1% ramp, but effectively we are increasing our 1% declared blocks, so it helps in getting our incentive of ramp
- During ramp up or down, the preference should be given to ramp not the DSM 
	-  for example, if first ramp down came, in which we are suppose to achieve 0.5%, we try, but during that, say the frequency is higher and so we are doing over injection, and so loss, it is acceptable, because for achieving ramp you did what you had to, and it's ok if you get DSM loss
