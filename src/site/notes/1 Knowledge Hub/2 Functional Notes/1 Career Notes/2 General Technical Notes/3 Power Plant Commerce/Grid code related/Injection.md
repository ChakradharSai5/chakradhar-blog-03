- Under injection is beneficial relatively to over injection
- over injection is more costly compared to under injection,
- With same MW difference, if the average frequency is higher, loss to is us more, on contrast, if average frequency is lower, the loss will be lesser
- In that figure, the top part - in under injection, for profit the frequency need to be higher, and in over injection - bottom part, for profit the frequency should be lower, in both cases we have less profit - observe top left and bottom right part
- Same way, in under injection, for loss, we get some loss notice top right part & for over injection, for loss, the frequency need to be higher- bottom left part, in both losses notice the the over injection - higher frequency, is heavier than the other loss.
- **Hence it is preferable, to do under injection, irrespective of frequency.**
