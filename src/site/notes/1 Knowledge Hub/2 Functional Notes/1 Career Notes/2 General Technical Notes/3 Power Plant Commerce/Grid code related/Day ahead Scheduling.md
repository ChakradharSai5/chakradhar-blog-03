### DC Scheduling Timeline & Strategy for Max commercial gain
![Pasted image 20250425225952.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20Functional%20Stuff/z-All%20pdfs,%20Images%20&%20Small%20Excalidraws/Pasted%20image%2020250425225952.png)
- NOTE: - Oil gun taking for DSM profit or ramp achievement is simply **stupid** , because one kL - which comes with 2 oil guns 15 mins - costs around 80,000Rs, which is very enormous compared to what we get in DSM or Ramp profits- as it will be usually in 100s and at max 1000s.
Before 2017 there is only DC, SG and AG only, after 2017, now, there are many components combine to give SG
#### Scheduling - This follows IEGC 2023
- As per IEGC 2023, At 0600Hrs, today we call D-1 day, we give DC - called punching - for next day - which technically is D day -Delivery Day
- By 0700Hrs, this same shall be communicated by RLDC to the respective beneficiaries, that their entitlement got decreased, and this calculation shall be in ratio fashion
	- Like for example say St-1 Kaniha has 40% Kerala and 60% Andhra Pradesh as beneficiaries, then, if St-1 Kaniha decreases DC by 100MW, then Kerala's entitlement shall decrease by 40MW and AP by 60MW
		- Entitlement is nothing but = (Percentage of Allocation x DC) 
- By 0800Hrs, SLDC shall punch in the respective beneficiaries requisition, nothing but their SGs
- By 0815Hrs and 0815Hrs intimation by NLDC to GNA for transmission constraint I guess and their revise requisitions if they have any limitation
	- During this time, I guess the NLDC again asks beneficiaries to revise their requisition, by using GNA and TGNA; 
	- GNA - General Network Access through PPF, & TGNA - Temporary General Network Access - temporary access of GNA on higher cost it seems
- by 0900Hrs, some shit with Regional TGNA not needed for us, and same kind of shit goes at 0915Hrs and 00945 Hrs
- Finally at 1000Hrs, our DAM Starts and ends at 1100Hrs
	- During this some real shit goes - say our beneficiary surrendered 100MW from say our 934.5DC, now that 100MW I can sell it in DAM - Day Ahead Market
	- here we at a station level we shall not be doing that, instead, NVVN takes that responsibility of that and does that planning for us for all the plants of NTPC, for smaller PSUs like NLC and other, they shall do it on their station level 
	- Earlier - before IEGC 2023, if a beneficiary surrenders 100MW we cannot sell in DAM, unless there is consent from beneficiary - which we cannot be sure we can rely on, hence in IEGC 2023, they have added a clause stating, if beneficiary surrenders, we can blindly can bid that in DAM without any consent from beneficiary
	- Bidding gets completed by 1100Hrs
- Though bidding gets completed b y 1100Hrs, some other shit - which we don't need to know  happens at 1145 & 1215Hrs and then
- At 1300Hrs, NLDC publishes schedule, which has two components obviously - ISGS (which is benefircy component) & DAM (which we gave the surrendered part for bidding)
	- Interesting part is on any D-1 day, if we check for D day, after 1330Hrs in NLDC schedule for our plant, we can see ISGS and DAM component.
- Now from 1400Hrs to 1430Hrs, something called SCUC shall happen, which we will see as follows [[1 Knowledge Hub/2 Functional Notes/1 Career Notes/2 General Technical Notes/3 Power Plant Commerce/Grid code related/SCUC\|SCUC]]
- After DAM revision, then Generators shall have no option to change DC, however beneficiaries shall have right to change SG after 1430Hrs i.e. after SCUC, they can do up or down,
- After 1430Hrs, we can check SG in NLDC website, if at that time, it is found that we got if any block below [[1 Knowledge Hub/2 Functional Notes/1 Career Notes/2 General Technical Notes/3 Power Plant Commerce/Grid code related/technical minimum\|technical minimum]] SG, and we have more than 8 blocks technical minimum SG for more than 8 blocks in [[1 Knowledge Hub/2 Functional Notes/1 Career Notes/2 General Technical Notes/3 Power Plant Commerce/Grid code related/Peak hours\|Peak hours]], then it is our right to ask NLDC to ask for above technical minimum for all blocks in a day
	- After DC and DAM declaration from our-generator- side, by 1430Hrs, say our SG for through out the day except in peak hours is less than technical minimum, for less than or equal to SG in peak hours has anyway shall be compensated, then we are suppose to shutdown the unit
	- Say for example, we got 30% instead of 55% - the technical minimum, according to IEGC 2023, we either shall run the unit higher than 30% and gets to bear the losses, or shut down the unit and it is our responsibility to buy power from else where and give it to our respective beneficiary
- After 1430Hrs, except for the units that got [[1 Knowledge Hub/2 Functional Notes/1 Career Notes/2 General Technical Notes/3 Power Plant Commerce/Grid code related/SCUC\|SCUC]], for all other generators, their respective beneficiaries can change the SG whenever and how much ever they want, they can simply make 0 also
	- for example, if a sudden cyclone came and frequency shot up, you may get SG 0, and you stop unit 
	- this is unfair, so they made amendment in IEGC 2023, 
		- first amendment, they made rule that after 1430Hrs, beneficiary can reduce up to their own 55%, however this still did not solve the problem completely, as it is so may happen that the one of many beneficiary's 55% might be less than 55% of generators
		- Hence, another amendment came, where they said that the beneficiaries' can reduce SG after 1430Hrs, only up to limitation from generators 55%, which shall beg the question how to distribute, simply, based on the beneficiary's ratio of SG they have given, it is derived by simply ratio of their SG
- It is imperative to note that, this all works after 1430Hrs, to save us from having SG below technical minimum, however there's a chance we might get SG below Techmin before 1430Hrs, which may or may not get compensated by [[SCED\|SCED]] or [[1 Knowledge Hub/2 Functional Notes/1 Career Notes/2 General Technical Notes/3 Power Plant Commerce/Grid code related/SCUC\|SCUC]] or [[RTM\|RTM]]
- We have discussed up to 1430Hrs, from here to 2355hrs, many things happen related to RTM, SCED & Ancillary services, we don't need to know that
**NOTE**: From here that is 2335Hrs, we can say real time starts, we say so, because, for 00Hrs, the process of running software for calculating stuff related to RTM or Network, all these real time things, shall start and finalize from 2335hrs, is what I understood, and final shedule gets published by RLDC and D-day starts at 0000Hrs
