- We have for example TSTPS Kaniha Stage-1 with 
	- Installed Capacity 1000MW
	- APC 6.55%(2024-29 Tariff) - so 65.5MW
	- Our DC shall be always Installed capacity minus APC
		- Hence 1000-6.55% = 934.5MW
### Plant Availability Factor PAF :
- % of Generation on line hours
- Say for ex: For a month I run a unit for 700Hrs
- And total supposed to be run hours are 744Hrs(31 x 24)
- So AVF = 700/744 % = 94.08%
### Plant load Factor PLF : 
- % of Generation actually generated compared to suppose to be generated units in million unit
- Say for Ex : For a month we are taking 744Hrs as our in line hours, (if  month of 31 days, if  month of 30 days - 720Hrs, if feb also 672Hrs or 696Hrs )
- For each hours a 500MW unit generates 0.5 million unit
- so for 744Hrs suppose generated is 744 x 0.5 = 372 million units
- But say I have generated only 300mu, then
	- PLF = (300/372)% = 80.64%
### Loading Factor
- LF = PLF/AVF
### Declared capacity DC :
- DC is calculated for without APC portion only
-  Say for stage-1 TSTPS we have 1000MW capcity and our APC is 6.55% (2024-25)
- So DC = 1000 - 6.55% = 934.5MW
- So for a month of January 
	- = ( (934.5 x 24) / (1000) ) x 31
	- 695.268mu
- So say actully we decalred 616.268mu
	- our DC = (616.2683 / 695.268) % = 88.64%
### APC
- APC calculation is done by actully measuring through meter of UT-A & UT-B and from the totoal generation this is subsctracted
- Ex : My generation for Jan 2024 i s621.4024mu
	- and my APC is 45.2982mu (From UT-A & UT-B reading)
	- Therefore my actual APC  =( 45.2982 / 621.4024 )% = 7.28%
### Schedule Generation SG
- is what Grid has asked us to run
- Ex : Say a for a month of Jan 25
- SG is 577.7207mu
- it means out of 695.28mu, assuming 744mu if 1000MW and APC 6.55%, we were asked to run 577.7207mu
- Therefore, SG % = ( 577.7207 / 695.28 )% = 83.09%

#### Note:
- So you can take Thumb rule like 744mu is reference if 100MW for 31 Days, changes as per unit or days,
