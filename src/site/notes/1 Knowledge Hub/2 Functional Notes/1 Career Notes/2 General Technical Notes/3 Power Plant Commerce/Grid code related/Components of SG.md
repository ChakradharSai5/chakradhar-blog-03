#### DAM
- Is something, that is decided a day before, D-1 Day we shall give at 1000Hrs to 1100Hrs, but I don't know why it is being said that it gets freezes at 15000Hrs
#### ISGS
- This is something that is given in D-1 day itself, but beneficiaries can revise it whenever they want up to D day's T1 block
- So you can say, for every odd block:T7 or every even block:T8 delivery block, ISGS gets freezed at T1 block
- for clarity refer [[1 Knowledge Hub/2 Functional Notes/1 Career Notes/2 General Technical Notes/3 Power Plant Commerce/Grid code related/Real Time Scheduling\|Real Time Scheduling]]
#### GNA, TGNA, URS
- This GNA - is kind of medium network access
- TGNA- is short term network access
- URS - if any beneficiary surrenders in T1 block other can avail, for clarity refer [[1 Knowledge Hub/2 Functional Notes/1 Career Notes/2 General Technical Notes/3 Power Plant Commerce/Grid code related/Real Time Scheduling\|Real Time Scheduling]]
- So all this gets freezed at D day's T1 block end
#### RTM
- Added in T4 block, from [[1 Knowledge Hub/2 Functional Notes/1 Career Notes/2 General Technical Notes/3 Power Plant Commerce/Grid code related/Real Time Scheduling\|Real Time Scheduling]]
#### TRAS

- Added and gets freezed in T5 block
#### SCED
- For odd block, in T5, for Even blcok in T6
#### AGC
