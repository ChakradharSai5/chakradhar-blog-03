Figure-2

For our-generator perspective, 
- Simply see that from figure-2 the revision of DC for partial load that is done in any odd block shall gets implemented which we call T1 block shall gets implemented from T7 block, that is in simple language, **if you are revising in an odd block we term that as T1 block and delivery block shall be T7 block**
- Now for even block, you just understand that, the block you revise shall be taken as T0 block, and the resto of the things goes the same way except our delivery shall be in T8 block, like in simple language, **if you revise in an even block, the block you revise shall be called T0 and the block that gets delivered is T8 block**

- 4 Revisions in a day on account of Partial load due to any problem pertaining to station & Total 60 Revisions in a month
- During Unit tripping, immediate DC revision to be done, because if done immediate and with mail to NLDC, for 8 blocks we shall be given DSM protection - that is no loss no profit
	- ==**Good thing is this works if any mill tripped on feeder tripped - may be for an act of god** - They will allow the same, that is we will any way revise our DC as per our allowance of 4 revision per day, however, by giving mail with the reason stating, they will consider and calculate Net DSM 0 for those 8 blocks up to which our DC revision comes in effect - similar to Unit tripping scenario==
	- The proof may be attached later, may be in half an hour, proof could be PTW copy or notification or something like that
