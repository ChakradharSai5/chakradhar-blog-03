# **Breakdown of Tariff Regulations (2019–24)**

The Tariff Regulations (2019–24) issued by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) establish the methodology and process for determining tariffs—that is, the prices paid by power buyers (e.g., distribution companies or beneficiaries) to power sellers (generating companies and transmission licensees). These regulations cover both new and existing projects (with transitional provisions) for the tariff period from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2024.

---

## **I. Preamble and General Scope**

### **1. Notification & Legal Basis**

- **Issuing Authority:**
    - The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) of New Delhi.
- **Notification Date:**
    - Issued on 7th March 2019.
- **Legal Framework:**
    - Powers conferred under Section 178 (and Section 61) of the Electricity Act, 2003.
- **Commencement:**
    - These regulations come into force on 1 April 2019 and remain valid until 31 March 2024 (unless extended or reviewed earlier).

### **2. Applicability**

- **Projects Covered:**
    - Tariff determination for generating stations (or units thereof) and transmission systems (or elements thereof) where tariffs are determined by CERC.
- **Exclusions:**
    - Projects whose tariffs are discovered through competitive bidding as per guidelines issued by the Central Government.
    - Generating stations based on renewable sources of energy where separate tariff determination regulations apply (e.g., the Renewable Energy Tariff Regulations, 2017).

---

## **II. Chapter 1: Preliminary**

### **1. Short Title and Commencement**

- **Short Title:**
    - “Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Terms and Conditions of Tariff) Regulations, 2019.”
- **Duration:**
    - Effective from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2024, unless reviewed or extended by the Commission.
- **Transitional Provision:**
    - For generating stations or transmission systems declared in commercial operation before 1 April 2019 (but whose tariff has not been finally determined), tariffs for the period ending 31 March 2019 shall be determined as per earlier (e.g., 2014) regulations.

### **2. Scope and Extent of Application**

- **General Scope:**
    - These regulations apply in every case where the tariff for a generating station or a transmission system is to be determined by the Commission under Section 62 of the Electricity Act, read together with Section 79.
- **Special Cases:**
    - For projects where power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been executed before a specific cut-off date and where financial closure has not been achieved by 31 March 2019, additional beneficiary consents may be required for tariff determination.

### **3. Key Definitions**

A substantial portion of Chapter 1 is devoted to defining terms. Some of the essential definitions include:

- **Act:**
    - Refers to the Electricity Act, 2003.
- **Additional Capital Expenditure:**
    - Capital costs incurred (or projected to be incurred) after commercial operation.
- **Additional Capitalisation:**
    - Additional capital expenditure admitted by CERC after a prudence check.
- **Admitted Capital Cost:**
    - The portion of capital cost that has been approved (after a prudence check) to be recovered through tariff.
- **Auxiliary Energy Consumption (AUX):**
    - Energy used by the plant’s own ancillary equipment (e.g., for operating switchyards, transformers, etc.), expressed as a percentage of the gross energy generated.
- **Auditor:**
    - An independent auditor appointed under relevant provisions of the Companies Act.
- **Bank Rate:**
    - The one‑year marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR) of the State Bank of India plus 350 basis points.
- **Beneficiary:**
    - Typically a distribution licensee purchasing electricity under a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA).
- **Capital Cost:**
    - The total cost (subject to prudence checks) incurred on building the generating station or transmission system.
- **Declared Capacity, COD, SCOD:**
    - Technical parameters defined as per the Grid Code (e.g., Commercial Operation Date, Scheduled COD, etc.).
- **Other Terms:**
    - The document defines numerous other technical and financial terms (e.g., “De-capitalisation,” “Force Majeure,” “Input Price,” “Plant Load Factor (PLF),” etc.) that are essential for tariff determination.

### **4. Interpretations**

- **Time Definitions:**
    - “Day” is defined as a 24‑hour period starting at midnight.
    - “Quarter” and “Year” are defined in the context of financial periods, with different definitions for new projects (from COD) and existing projects (from 1 April to 31 March).

---

## **III. Chapter 2: Date of Commercial Operation (COD)**

### **1. Determination of COD**

- **Definition:**
    - The Commercial Operation Date is determined according to the provisions of the Grid Code.
- **Role of COD:**
    - COD is critical because it marks the date from which the project starts generating revenue and from which capital cost recovery begins.

### **2. Handling Mismatches**

- **Generating Station vs. Transmission System:**
    - In cases where a generating station’s COD does not match the COD of the associated transmission system (or vice versa), special provisions determine the allocation of transmission charges.
    - For example, if the generating station has not achieved COD on the transmission system’s COD date, the generating company must pay transmission charges until the plant attains COD.
- **Infirm Power:**
    - Power injected prior to the official COD (known as “infirm power”) is accounted for as a deviation and its revenue, after adjusting for fuel expenses, is used to adjust the capital cost.

---

## **IV. Chapter 3: Procedure for Tariff Determination**

### **1. Filing of Applications**

- **New Projects:**
    - Applications for tariff determination must be filed within 60 days of the anticipated COD.
    - Projects that have multiple units or elements are to be consolidated in the petition if they are expected to achieve COD within two months.
- **Existing Projects:**
    - Applications for existing projects must be filed by a specified deadline (e.g., 31 October 2019) and should include a “truing up” of the tariff for the previous period (e.g., 2014–19).

### **2. Information and Documentation Requirements**

- **Data Submission:**
    - Detailed breakdowns of capital expenditure, additional capital expenditure (both incurred and projected), and financing details are required.
- **Certification:**
    - Auditor certificates (or, if not available, management certificates signed by a high-level official) must be submitted to verify capital costs.
- **Interim Tariff:**
    - In cases where the final tariff has not yet been determined, an interim tariff (based on previous rates and available data) is applied.

### **3. Public Consultation and Hearings**

- **Stakeholder Involvement:**
    - The Commission holds hearings that include the petitioner (the generating company or transmission licensee), respondents, consumer associations, and other stakeholders.
- **Truing Up:**
    - A “truing up” exercise is conducted to adjust for any discrepancies between projected and actual capital expenditure.
    - Refunds or additional recoveries are calculated based on whether actual additional capital expenditure deviates from the projection by more than 10%, with interest applied as appropriate.

---

## **V. Chapter 4: Tariff Structure**

### **1. Components of Tariff**

- **Two Primary Components for Generating Stations:**
    1. **Capacity Charge:**
        - This is a fixed charge intended to recover annual fixed costs, including:
            - Return on equity
            - Interest on loan capital
            - Depreciation
            - Interest on working capital
            - Operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses
        - These costs reflect the availability of capacity regardless of how much energy is generated.
    2. **Energy (Variable) Charge:**
        - This charge is variable and is based on the actual energy produced.
        - It primarily recovers:
            - Primary fuel costs (e.g., coal, lignite, gas)
            - Secondary fuel costs (if applicable)
            - Costs of reagents (e.g., limestone)
        - Adjustments may be made for refunds of taxes, duties, or penalties from fuel suppliers.
- **Supplementary Charges:**
    - Additional capacity charges and energy charges may be levied for:
        - Additional capitalization (costs incurred after COD)
        - Implementation of revised emission standards
        - Renovation and modernisation expenses

### **2. Tariff for Transmission Systems**

- **Transmission Charges:**
    - These are determined for the entire transmission network or for individual elements (e.g., substations, communication systems).
    - The transmission charges are designed to recover the fixed costs associated with the transmission system.

---

## **VI. Chapter 5: Capital Structure**

### **1. Debt–Equity Ratio**

- **For New Projects:**
    - A normative debt–equity ratio of 70:30 is prescribed. This means 70% of the project funding is expected to be in the form of debt, and 30% in equity.
    - If actual equity exceeds 30%, the excess is treated as a “normative loan” for tariff calculation.
    - Conversely, if equity is less than 30%, then the actual equity level is used.
- **For Existing Projects:**
    - The previously determined debt–equity ratio (approved for earlier tariff periods) is carried forward unless revised by the Commission.
- **Special Provisions:**
    - Specific cases (e.g., projects owned by Damodar Valley Corporation) may follow a different regime as specified in the regulations.

---

## **VII. Chapter 6: Computation of Capital Cost**

### **1. Definition of Capital Cost**

- **Capital Cost:**
    - It is the total expenditure (subject to prudence checks) incurred or projected for setting up the generating station or transmission system. This cost forms the basis for tariff determination.

### **2. Components for New Projects**

- **Expenditure Up to COD:**
    - This includes all costs incurred from project initiation to the date of commercial operation.
- **Interest During Construction (IDC):**
    - Interest charges on debt funds from the date of debt infusion up to the Scheduled COD.
- **Financing Charges:**
    - Additional financing costs, including incidental expenditures during construction.
- **Foreign Exchange Adjustments:**
    - Any gains or losses related to fluctuations in exchange rates on borrowed funds.
- **Capitalised Initial Spares:**
    - Costs associated with spare parts, subject to prescribed ceiling rates.
- **Additional Capitalisation & De-capitalisation:**
    - Adjustments for costs incurred after COD or for removal of assets (if they are replaced or decommissioned).

### **3. Components for Existing Projects**

- **Trued-Up Historical Capital Cost:**
    - The capital cost as admitted by the Commission up to 31 March 2019 (after “truing up”).
- **Subsequent Additions:**
    - Any additional capitalization (or de‑capitalization) on a yearly basis, including costs for renovation and modernization.
- **Exclusions:**
    - Assets that are not in use, de-capitalized assets, or costs such as land (if specifically excluded) are not included in the capital cost.

---

## **VIII. Chapter 7: Computation of Additional Capital Expenditure**

### **1. Additional Capitalisation Within the Original Scope (Up to the Cut-off Date)**

- **Examples Include:**
    - Undischarged liabilities that are recognized to be payable in the future.
    - Deferred works or procurement of initial capital spares.
    - Liabilities arising from awards of arbitration or compliance with statutory orders.
    - Costs due to changes in law or force majeure events.
- **Adjustment for Replacements:**
    - In case of asset replacement, adjustments are made by reducing the gross fixed assets and cumulative depreciation of the replaced asset.

### **2. Additional Capitalisation After the Cut-off Date**

- **Within Original Scope:**
    - Similar items as above but incurred after the designated cut-off date.
- **Beyond Original Scope:**
    - Expenditures that extend beyond the originally approved scope may be considered separately.
    - For example, additional works for improved safety, extended capacity, or ancillary facilities beyond the original plan.

---

## **IX. Chapter 8: Renovation and Modernisation (R&M) and Special Allowance**

### **1. Renovation and Modernisation (R&M)**

- **Purpose:**
    - To extend the useful life of the generating station or transmission system beyond the originally recognized period.
- **Filing Requirements:**
    - The generating company or transmission licensee must file a petition for R&M approval.
    - The petition must include a Detailed Project Report covering:
        - Complete scope of work.
        - Justification and cost–benefit analysis.
        - Estimated life extension from a reference date.
        - Financial package and schedule of completion.
        - Beneficiary consent (if required).
- **After Approval:**
    - Once approved, the additional capital expenditure (after deducting any depreciation already recovered) is used as the basis for tariff determination.

### **2. Special Allowance Option for Coal-based/Lignite-fired Stations**

- **Alternative to R&M:**
    - Instead of undertaking full renovation and modernization, a generating station may opt to claim a “special allowance.”
- **Rate:**
    - The special allowance is prescribed (e.g., at a rate of Rs.9.5 lakh per MW per year for the tariff period 2019–24).
- **Conditions:**
    - This option is not available to stations that have already undergone R&M or those operating under relaxed norms due to depletion.
    - The special allowance is recovered as part of the annual fixed cost but does not lead to an upward revision of the capital cost.

## **X. Summary of the Tariff Determination Process**

1. **Preliminary Stage:**
    - The document establishes the legal and operational framework, including key definitions and the scope of application.
2. **Determination of COD:**
    - Defines when a project is considered operational, with special provisions for mismatches and infirm power.
3. **Filing and Processing:**
    - Applicants (generating companies or transmission licensees) submit detailed petitions including capital cost data and financing information.
    - Public consultations and hearings are held, and interim tariffs may be applied.
4. **Tariff Structure:**
    - Tariff is divided into:
        - **Capacity Charge:** Recovering fixed costs.
        - **Energy (Variable) Charge:** Recovering costs directly related to fuel and operation.
    - Supplementary charges may apply as needed.
5. **Cost Recovery Mechanism:**
    - The tariff is derived from an in-depth computation of the capital cost (including IDC, IEDC, additional capital expenditure, etc.) and operating costs.
    - A prudence check and “truing up” exercises ensure that only reasonable and efficient costs are recovered.
6. **Capital Structure and Financial Adjustments:**
    - Specific debt–equity norms and adjustments for additional capitalization are set.
    - Special arrangements (e.g., special allowance for certain types of stations) are provided.
7. **Final Tariff Determination:**
    - After review, the Commission finalizes the tariff, which is then used to bill beneficiaries over the tariff period.
