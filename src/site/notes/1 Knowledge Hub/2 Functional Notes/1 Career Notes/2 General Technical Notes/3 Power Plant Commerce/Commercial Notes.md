## **COMMERCIAL ASPECTS:**

- WHAT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND MAINLY HERE ARE TWO THINGS:
    - 1. AFC
    - 2. DSM- Deviation Settlement Mechanism
- 2. DSM:
    - In 2022 CERC did many experiments, in the middle they removed incentive linked to freq stabilization to the sellers, which created a huge problem in managing the grid frequency stabilizing.
    - So after multiple trials they have formulated the below way that i am going to tell now, effective fro 2023 08 Feb
    - There is something called NRCD normal rate of charges of deviation which is
        - = highest of ( the weighted average ACP of the DAM/RTM of all the Power Exchanges for that time block): subject to a ceiling of Rs 12 per kWh
    - For us reference charge rate= energy charge rate RCR=ECR
    - First, remember the rule that for any deviation from SG, there is a pool called Deviation and Ancillary Service Pool account, and that account gets either seller pays in it, or seller gets paid by grid into it.
        - Ideally**(means freq=50.00Hz**) suppose if i am seller and i generate more than SG, for that deviation i shall get paid 100%ECR, that much money gets deposited in that DASP account, as I have generated extra power and it is only fair that I should get back amount how much ever it costed me(ECR) for generating that deviation.
        - Same way ideally**(means freq=50.00Hz**) suppose i generate less than SG, i will pay in to 100%ECR DASP account, as actually i did not spend that much amount while generating power., so it is only fair that i should pay back grid how much ever(ECR) I saved while not generating that deviation power.
    - Now CERC gave us this “Ideal” margin as 49.95-50.03Hz, if freq is between this I can generate more than SG or less than SG, I gain or lose nothing.
    - BUT if freq goes less than 49.95Hz or more than 50.03Hz, then depending on whether i generate more or less than SG, I shall be incentivized or penalized.
    -DSM & Relater Matters, Regulations by CERC 2024 dated 5th Aug, 2024
To understand this, first we need to understand, this following things:
    1. There is pool called Deviation and Ancillary Service pool, which shall be used by Grid and power generators for real time settling of payment in Deviation
    2. Now you know that we give DC, NLDC/RLDC gives us SG, we have to simply follow SG
    3. Say I did overgeneration, ideally from my side, to make me no profit and no loss - Grid should give me my cost of power how much ever I deviated
        Ex: say my SG 100MW and I generated 105MW, for this 5MW, it costed me my ECR*(units of power of deviation of that block i.e 5MW) as that much cost is what I incurred in burning my coal to generate that power of 5MW, as any way my 100MW ECR shall get paid in my regular payment
    4. Say I did under generation, ideally from my side, to make me no profit and no loss - I should give back the cost of power how much ever I deviated
        Ex: Say my SG 100MW and I generated 90MW, for this 10MW, it DIDN'T cost me my ECR(units of power of deviation of that block i.e 10MW), but as any way I am going to get 100MW ECR regular payment, it is only fair(for no profit or no loss) for me to payback this 10MW ECR cost that I did not spend, as I did not generated
Now
Final things to keep in mind for intutive understanding is
**1. If over Generation ideally(For no profit, no loss) Grid should pay to pool 100%ECR for the deviation between SG & AG**
**2. If under Generation ideally (For no profit & no loss) you should pay  to pool 100%ECR for the deviation between SG & AG**
**3. This penalizing or incentivizing shall be done by reducing or increasing this 100%ECR that is paid by us or paid to us**
To incentivize/dis-incentivize depending on various conditions, CERC gives this regulations as follows as on 2024 5th Aug, for 2024-25 Fiscal year
