#OfficeNote
- Volumetric feeders: rely on volume measurements
?
	- we have to decide certain dispense rate like 1kg/60sec
	- and then we have do multiple trials and adjustments to make the feeder give same amount of volume of coal(say) per that time by collecting coal each time we run the feeder, if it is more or less, we adjust the feeder speed accordingly
	- less accurate
	- must be repeated if density changes or ingredient ratios
- Gravimetric feeder : rely on weight measurements
?
	- A load cell will be there and will be continuously measuring weight,
	- User will give the dispensing rate and the controller/processor will calculate the speed of the feeder required based on the current running weight  of coal(say) on the feeder, and gets the feeder to that particular speed
