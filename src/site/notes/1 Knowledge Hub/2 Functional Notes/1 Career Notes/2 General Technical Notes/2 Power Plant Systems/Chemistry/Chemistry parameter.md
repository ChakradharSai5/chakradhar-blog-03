#OfficeNote
# Tan Number

TAN: total acid number, there is TBN also Total base number
- but we usually use TAN here, which is measured by the amount of KOH in milligrams that is needed to neutralize the acids in one gram of oil.
- usual limit is 0.1mg KOH/ 1gm of oil.

### Cation Conductivity
- One of the major contributor of cation conductivity is carbonic acid, which comes when there is air ingress, so when there is air ingress
- we know - in air
	- **Nitrogen (N₂):** 78%
	- **Oxygen (O₂):** 21%
	- **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):** ~0.04%
	- Trace gases (e.g., argon, neon, etc.)
- but usually at normal temperatures N2 is chemically inert, so the formation of nitric/nitrous acid is almost impossible
	- formation of NO is endothermic and requires >1000DegC and also a slow reaction
	- Formation of NO2 is slightly easier in terms of requires less temperature of around 200-600DegC
	- And this NO or NO2 dissolves in water to give nitric or nitrous acid which is quite a far fetched in regular air ingress at condensate or feedwater cycle, as temperatures are quite low
- however CO2 with air ingress in to line can easily form carbonic acid, very rapid and easy,  
	- Carbon dioxide gas dissolves in water. This step is **physical** and depends on the partial pressure of CO₂ and the temperature.
	- Lower temperatures increase the solubility of CO₂ in water, enhancing carbonic acid formation.
	- Example: At 25°C, the solubility of CO₂ in water is higher than at 60°C.
	- And this carbonic acid gives H+ ions which in turn will increase the cation conductivity
- so It is the **primary cause** of increased cation conductivity in air-ingress scenarios in power plants.
- measured in micro siemens/cm, cation exchange resin 
- refer [[1 Knowledge Hub/1 My Joyful Interests/Science/Hydration Property\|Hydration Property]], for better understanding of ions stably present in water, so this causes any salts present in water to be in ion form and so causes high conductivity, which we neutralize by making it react with resin, 
	- A **cation exchange resin** is a specially designed polymer material that can exchange that resin's hydrogen ions (**H⁺**) with cations (positively charged ions like Na⁺, Ca²⁺, etc.) present in the water. An example of simple could be like
		- Na⁺(aq)+Resin-SO₃H→ Resin-SO₃Na  + H⁺
		- aq means that is in water hydro shelled.
		- this gives out this H+ ion to water which also gets hydroshelled or may get converted to water so safe no issue
	- similarly it is passed through **anion exhange bed**, and makes Cl- or other anions to get removed with OH- ions, which makes water more basic
	- and this both H+ and OH- reacts to form water and that's absolutely fine
