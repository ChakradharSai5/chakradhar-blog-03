?

- This is sleeve that is used to
protect shaft, as when shaft
rotates gland protects water
to not come outside, however
gets to friction with sleeve,
so after some time sleeve gets
damage and we will replace
sleeve, if there is no sleeve shaft
gets damaged and it costs more to replace
- There is something called **Shaft Seals**, which are basically cylindrival sleeve rings that are inesrted on shafts, that are there because due to friction with gland we don't want shaft to get damage, because replaceing shaft is costly, instead we put gland on top of **shaft seals rings** so that later when this gets wear and tear, we will replace shaft seals rings only - not shaft - less costly and less work

Note: water HAS to come out of gland drop wise to keep the gland
not to get heated up, if you put gland such a tight that 
not even a single drop comes out, then gland gets heated up
early and starts getting damage to gland or sleeve
