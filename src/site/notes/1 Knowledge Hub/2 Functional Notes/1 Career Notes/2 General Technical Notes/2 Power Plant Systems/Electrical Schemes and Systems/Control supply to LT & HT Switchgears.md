- For LT Switchgears usually the control supply shall be an AC supply and for that mostly that MCC shall have a control transformer which steps down the LT voltage that comes which is typically 415V, to 110V and that 110V shall be used for control supply for operating contacts for all that LT drives, also for some, in Talcher Kaniha atlleast, for sootblower homeposition limit switch contact is also being sensed with this 110V AC supply
- For HT Switchgears, the control supply is taken from this 220V DCDB supply, for all the HT Switchgears that are 3.3kv and 11kv and Transformer breakers also same thing goes.
