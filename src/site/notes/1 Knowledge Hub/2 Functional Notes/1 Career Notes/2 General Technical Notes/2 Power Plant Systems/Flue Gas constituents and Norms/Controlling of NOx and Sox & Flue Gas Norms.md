#OfficeNote

To reduce NOx emissions in thermal power plants, here are some simple ways:

1. **Over Fire Burners (OFB)**: These burners add extra air above the flame to lower combustion temperatures, reducing NOx formation, and also reduce the amount of air at the combustion as this also reduces the NOx formation. refer [[#• Controlling and norms on flue gas]]
2. **Flue Gas Recirculation (FGR)**: Recirculating some of the exhaust gases back into the combustion chamber lowers the temperature, helping to cut down NOx.
3. **Low NOx Burners**: These are specially designed burners that help mix air and fuel more efficiently, keeping the combustion temperature lower and reducing NOx.
4. **SCR & SNCR**: Technologies like Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) inject chemicals to turn NOx into harmless gases
6. **Optimized Combustion**: Ensuring the right balance of air and fuel during combustion helps reduce high-temperature zones that produce NOx.
### Current NOx Emission Norms in India:

- For plants commissioned before 2003: Max 600 mg/Nm³
- For plants commissioned between 2004-2016: Max 450 mg/Nm³
- For plants commissioned after 2017: Max 100 mg/Nm³
## • Controlling and norms on flue gas
- NOx limit
    - before 2003 commissioned plants has 600mg/Nm3, so Kaniha has 600mg/Nm3
    - after 2004-2016 commissioned plants has 300mg/Nm3
        70–90 per cent of total air given at burner, leading partial combustion of fuel, and balance is injected above burner elevation, where combustion gets completed, the relatively low temp. of secondary stage limits the production of thermal NOx
        - To reduce _thermal_ NOx we can use OVF ,basically total air is not given right away at burner, some part of air given at above all burners, so that near burner localized O2 deficit happens and so reduces NOx ,
- Sox limit
    - 600mg/Nm3 for less than 500MW,
    - 200mg/Nm3 for greater than or equal to 500MW, so Kaniha 200mg/Nm3![pUCt1Sn - Imgur.jpg](/img/user/Obsidian%20Functional%20Stuff/z-All%20pdfs,%20Images%20&%20Small%20Excalidraws/pUCt1Sn%20-%20Imgur.jpg)




- SPM limit is 50mg/Nm3
- CO limit??
