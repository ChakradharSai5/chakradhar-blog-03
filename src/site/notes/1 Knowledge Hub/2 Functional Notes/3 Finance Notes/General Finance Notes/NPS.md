### NPS - EXIT
#### Withdrawal Rules at Maturity (Upon Retirement at Age 60 or Superannuation)
##### Lump Sum Withdrawal**:
- You can withdraw up to 60% of your total accumulated corpus as a tax-free lump sum upon reaching the age of 60 or upon superannuation.
##### Annuity Purchase:
- The remaining 40% of the corpus must be used to purchase an annuity that provides a regular pension. While the purchase of the annuity is tax-exempt, the pension income received from the annuity is taxable as per your applicable income tax slab. 
##### Exception for Smaller Corpus:
- If the total accumulated corpus is ₹5 lakh or less, you are allowed to withdraw the entire amount as a lump sum, and this withdrawal is tax-free. ​

#### Premature Exit (Before Age 60)
##### Eligibility:
- Premature exit is permitted only after completing 10 years in the NPS. 
##### Withdrawal Provisions:
- You can withdraw up to 20% of the accumulated corpus as a lump sum, which is tax-free. The remaining 80% must be used to purchase an annuity that provides a regular pension. The annuity purchase is tax-exempt, but the pension income received from the annuity is taxable as per your income tax slab. ​
##### Exception for Smaller Corpus:
- If the total corpus is ₹2.5 lakh or less, you can withdraw the entire amount as a lump sum, and this withdrawal is tax-free.

#### Withdrawal Rules in Case of Death of the Subscriber**

##### Before Retirement:
- In the unfortunate event of the subscriber's demise before reaching 60 years, the entire accumulated corpus is paid to the nominee(s) or legal heirs as a lump sum, and this amount is tax-free. ​
##### After Retirement:
- If the subscriber passes away after starting the annuity, the treatment of the remaining corpus depends on the terms of the annuity plan chosen. Some annuity plans offer benefits to the nominee upon the annuitant's death.​
####  Systematic Lump Sum Withdrawal (SLW) Facility

##### Flexibility in Withdrawals:
- NPS subscribers have the option to withdraw the 60% lump sum in a phased manner through the Systematic Lump Sum Withdrawal (SLW) facility. This allows you to receive the lump sum periodically (monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annually) post-retirement, up to the age of 75. 
##### Tax Implications:
-  Each withdrawal under SLW is tax-free, provided it falls within the 60% lump sum withdrawal limit. The remaining 40% allocated for annuity purchase follows the standard taxation rules.​
