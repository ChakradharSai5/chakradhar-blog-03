The **triple tax exemption (EEE)** of Provident Fund (PF) in India means:

1. **Contribution**: Employee contributions to PF are tax-deductible under Section 80C (up to ₹1.5 lakh/year). Employer contributions are tax-free up to 12% of salary.
2. **Interest**: Interest earned is tax-free, with limits (e.g., EPF: tax-free up to ₹2.5 lakh/year contributions; PPF: fully tax-free).
3. **Withdrawal**: Withdrawals are tax-free if conditions are met (e.g., 5 years of service for EPF or after 15 years for PPF).
