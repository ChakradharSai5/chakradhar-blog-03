If you rent out a house, please do not make the mistake of using a “Rent Agreement” or “Lease Agreement”...  
  
A Rent Agreement gives the legal right to “possession” of a house property to the Tenant...  
  
And you’d have heard stories of how properties have been unfairly possessed by tenant families for generations, who demand an obscene amount of money from the Landlord to release the property...  
  
The Landlord is unable to get the tenants out, unable to increase the rent, and unable to sell the property.  
  
All because the Tenant is offered protection under the Rent Control Act, which guards them from being evicted, and also puts a cap on how much rent can be charged or increased annually.  
  
👉🏼 Which is why, you must always instead enter into a “Leave & License Agreement”  
  
It enables the Landlord (Licensor) to retain the legal possession of the property, and only gives the right for temporary stay to the Tenant (Licensee) as per a License to stay for a specified period only...  
  
Keeping the agreement outside of the purview of the Rent Control Act, and the Rent is termed as “License Fee”... (agreement is covered under the Indian Easement Act, 1882, just for legal nerds)  
  
This way, even if the Landlord or Tenant passes away, or the Landlord sells the property to a third person, the Agreement automatically ends, which doesn’t in the case of a Rent Agreement but does for a Leave & License Agreement.  
  
👉🏼 Now comes the second part... of why people make 11 month agreements...  
  
Because Agreements up to 11 months don’t need to be registered under the Registration Act...  
  
However, Leave & License Agreements must be registered regardless of the duration under the state’s stamp duty act and rules.  
  
The Rent Control Act has different limits for various states so be sure to check your respective state’s rules… also the court may decide whether an agreement is for license or rent depending on the words of the agreement too.
