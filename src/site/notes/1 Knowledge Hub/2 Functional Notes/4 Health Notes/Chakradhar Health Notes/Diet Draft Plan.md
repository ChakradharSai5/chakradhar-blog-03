    - 67kg/148lb
    - Cutting intake: 147 x 12 = 1776kcal
        - 27% PR = 480, /4 =120gm
        - 33% F= 586, /9 = 65gm
        - 40% C= 710, /4 = 177gm
    - Therefore 120gm protein, 65gm fat, 180gm carb round figured
- Outside food as you cannot choose Protean rich food, go for vegetable rich food so at least fiber will give less insulin spike
