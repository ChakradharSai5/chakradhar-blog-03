### Plan-01 Aggressive Fat loss
- Here goal is aggresive fat loss atleast till 70kg, then we can go for warrior building program
- MY Goal : 
	- 70kg weight, with 20-22% body fat, 
#### Diet Plan
- As per Kinobody, aggressive fat loss at 11kcal per pound of body weight, and in that 35% Protien, 35% Carbs, 30% Fat
	- So my **Goal weight** is 70kg so, in pounds that is 154pounds
		- so 154 x 11 = 1694kcal ~ 1700kcal
		- In that 35% protein = ~150gm protein
		- 35% Carb = ~ 150gm carb
		- 30% Fat = ~ 56gm Fat
		- In fact, this Carb and Fat may vary, but protein need to be reached
		- And once a Rota I should up by calorie in by 600kcal in a day
	- I am planning to do it religiously for 6 weeks
- After end of this 6 weeks, I may get to 22% body fat, and 71kg, may be if I continue to do it, as I go Chandragiri, for another 2 weeks then 70kg 20% body fat
### Exercise plan
- Here comes another important thing, as per chatGPT, during this aggressive fat loss cutting program, we will not be increasing our strength, our strength stays mostly constant or rises slightly high the only difference is the definition, and more defined and sculpted. unless I am a beginner, so let us see what happens only thing to keep in mind, though I don't see any progress, I have to keep going, because this will add up to the muscle definition
- So My plan is
#### Warm up
	Increases blood flow to musceles
	Loosens joint and prevent injury
	And for heavy lifts you know the warm up sets, activates the key muscles
- Stationary Cycle – 3-5 min or  Brisk Walk  (Incline 5%) – 2-3 min
