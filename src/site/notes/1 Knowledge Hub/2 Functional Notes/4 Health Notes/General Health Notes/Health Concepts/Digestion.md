Complex corbohydrate gets digested slowly because as the food goes through your intestine, it gets slowly disentigrated by enzymes in digestive system and as it is difficult and so takes time, the food goes up to small intestine end, and so our blood vessels absobs that energy from food slowly and so we don't feel much hunger .
If with simple carb, it gets digested fastly and so wounldn't last upto large intestine end.
