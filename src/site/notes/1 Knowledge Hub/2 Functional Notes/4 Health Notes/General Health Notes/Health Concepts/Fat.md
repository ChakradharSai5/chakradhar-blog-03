# Fat

- **fat**
    - Visceral fat- is fat around the organs - that doesn't respond **much** with caloric deficit - that makes belly protrude
        - at least 25gm fibre
        - less than 25gm added sugar in diet
        - cardio vascular exercise at regular basis
    - subcutaneous fat- fat under the skin- easily responds with caloric deficit
