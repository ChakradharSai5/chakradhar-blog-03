 was going through Indigo‚Äôs P&L for FY23 and turns out that ~14.5% of the operating revenues (net of subsidies) comes from the sale of goods in-flight, which primarily, is food and drinks.  
			  
			That‚Äôs over Rs 750 crores of F&B sales - which is more than the entire sales of Barbeque Nation for FY22 at like 160+ restaurants.  
			  
			That means at an average rate of Rs 250 per order value, 3 crore food items are sold on Indigo flights annually! That‚Äôs over 83k orders daily.  
			  
			Indigo runs 1900 daily flights!!!! Whattt!!!! (that‚Äôs the info I found online, but is hard to digest, quite like the cup noodles one gets on flights, which my wife quite enjoys)  
			  
			But assuming that‚Äôs true, it means ~50 people per flight buy food (pre-included or otherwise)... which could be close to 30% of the entire flight.  
			  
			While the other airlines like Vistara are in losses, GoAir has declared bankruptcy... Indigo declared ~13% EBITDA for FY23...  
			  
			Now a lot of this may sound like gross simplification and it probably is... but given airline food has a 90% gross margin if packaged food has +60% gross margin otherwise...  
			  
			You could also say that the profit from in flight sales is kinda sorta equal to the EBITDA margin of the company.  
			  
			There are several nuances to the airline businesses such as volatile fuel prices, lease rents of aircrafts and other aspects that I‚Äôve covered in detail in previous posts...  
			  
			But Indigo was the frontrunner of selling food separately in its flights, and quite like PVR - food has been the saviour.  
			  
			So ironic how restaurant and food businesses are the hardest to make profit in, but packaged food sales on an otherwise hard industry to make money in turns out to be the lifejacket.

- The impressive acoustic effect in front of the Temple in Chich√©n Itz√°.When you clap in front of a slope, the sound goes to the top. But if there is a cavity or hollow chamber at the top, as in this case of the Temple at the Pyramid of Kulkulk√°n, also known as El Castillo, the sound returns.  
	  
	What intrigues people who know the place most is that the sound produced by the echo resembles the sound emitted by Quetzal, a majestic bird adored by the Mayans as a ‚ÄúGod of the Air‚Äù. There are indications that the effect wasn‚Äôt created by chance, and even acoustics and bird experts agree.  
	  
	In addition to this acoustic intelligence, the construction demonstrates deep knowledge of  
	mathematics, geometry and astronomy that the Mayans possessed. The Mayans observed in detail the behavior of the seasons, the variations of the trajectories of the Sun and the stars, and printed various accurate information about these insights into the structure of buildings.  
	  
	For example, this pyramid has 4 stairs of 91 steps,and an upper step towards the altar, adding 365 steps - one for each day of the year. An acoustics expert named Nico Declercq also noticed that the height and spacing of the pyramid‚Äôs steps create an acoustic filter that emphasizes some sound  
	frequencies while suppressing others, causing people‚Äôs steps to when they went up they sounded a lot like rain falling in a bucket of water. The God of Rain played an important role in Mayan Culture, so that also can‚Äôt be a coincidence.  
	  
	During the Equinox, the shadow of the platforms is projected onto the stairs in the form of a snake. As the sun advances, this snake seems to be going downward to Earth. This represents the descent of the God Kukulk√°n (‚ÄúFeatured Serpent‚Äù), symbolizing the beginning of the sowing and harvesting seasons.
