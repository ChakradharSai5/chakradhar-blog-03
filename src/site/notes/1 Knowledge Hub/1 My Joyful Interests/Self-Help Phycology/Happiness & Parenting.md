I guess happiness is not what we should we go after, we should go after things that make us feel “Flow” or that makes you live in that moment
### **The Nature of Success and Parenting**

#### **The Pressure to Be Successful:**

- **Concept**: From childhood, many of us are taught that success is the ultimate goal in life. This success is usually defined by tangible achievements—like grades, awards, or a high-paying job.
- **Example**: A child might be pushed to study for hours, join extracurriculars, and aim for top grades. They might even be told, "Success is all that matters," which can create a lot of stress.

**Simplified Breakdown**:

- Growing up, you were likely taught that doing well in studies and getting good results would lead to success.
- Success is often seen as an outcome—whether it’s a government job, big promotions, or being recognized as a top achiever in a field.
- This mindset can create pressure, leaving little room for other aspects of life, such as friendships, hobbies, or self-discovery.

#### **The Cost of Focusing Solely on Success:**

- **Concept**: Focusing too much on "success" can lead to missing out on things that truly matter, like forming relationships, following passions, and experiencing life’s joys.
- **Example**: You may have had a tight focus on academics and career goals. In doing so, you might have ignored friendships or passions (like filmmaking) that could have enriched your life.

**Simplified Breakdown**:

- If you're always working towards success, you might lose sight of what makes you happy in the moment.
- As you reflect on your past, you realize that, while success is important, the journey, relationships, and personal growth hold much more meaning than achieving a specific goal.
- Life becomes about living authentically and exploring what you love, instead of being solely driven by external expectations.

#### **Reevaluating Success:**

- **Concept**: As we grow older, we often realize that success is not about achieving external markers like a high-paying job, awards, or fame. Instead, it’s about finding peace, joy, and authenticity in our everyday lives.
- **Example**: After reaching a stable job like yours at NTPC, you start to question whether this is the "success" you envisioned. You now realize that true success is doing what you love, finding balance, and enjoying life’s journey, not just pursuing external validation.

**Simplified Breakdown**:

- Success, as society defines it, can sometimes be misleading. People may feel successful in terms of status, but often, this doesn’t lead to happiness or fulfillment.
- What you might truly value is inner peace, connection with others, personal growth, and the freedom to explore life on your terms.
- Shifting your focus from "success" to "living authentically" can be a liberating realization.

#### **The Influence of Parenting on This Perspective:**

- **Concept**: Parenting plays a huge role in shaping our mindset. If a child is raised with constant pressure to succeed, it can lead to stress, self-doubt, and a narrow definition of success.
- **Example**: Think of how Yuvaraj Singh’s father pushed him to be the best cricketer. While Yuvaraj succeeded, we also see how it led to struggles along the way. Many other parents do this too, pushing their kids toward a specific goal.

**Simplified Breakdown**:

- Parents who pressure their children to succeed, often unknowingly, create an environment where the child feels constant stress.
- Parents may think they are helping by pushing their children, but in doing so, they might ignore the child’s true needs—like emotional support, friendships, or the freedom to explore passions without fear of failure.
- The risk here is that, while some children may succeed under this pressure, many do not, and the ones who do might feel disconnected from their true selves, which could affect their happiness in the long run.

#### **Personal Growth Beyond External Success:**

- **Concept**: True personal growth comes from understanding yourself, your passions, and what brings you joy. This growth is not measured by external achievements but by your journey and how true you remain to your values.
- **Example**: After working for NTPC, you started realizing that your definition of success was limited. Now, you are embracing the idea of living authentically, pursuing your interests, and understanding who you are.

**Simplified Breakdown**:

- Life isn’t just about "getting somewhere"—it’s about enjoying the journey.
- By reflecting on your past, you’ve realized that focusing solely on external measures of success might have caused you to overlook personal growth and fulfillment.
- Now that you're rediscovering passions like filmmaking and nurturing your family relationships, you're starting to experience a more balanced, meaningful life.

---

#### **Finding Balance and Joy:**

- **Concept**: It's important to strike a balance between work, passion, and personal life. By doing so, you can lead a fulfilling life without falling into the trap of constant striving for success.
- **Example**: You’ve started reconnecting with passions like filmmaking and rediscovering who you are outside of your professional identity.

**Simplified Breakdown**:

- Balance means you can enjoy your work, but also carve out time for things that bring you joy and peace—whether that’s hobbies, spending time with loved ones, or simply relaxing.
- Success is redefined here not as the end goal but as a fulfilling, well-rounded life where you are free to pursue your passions, relationships, and personal growth.
