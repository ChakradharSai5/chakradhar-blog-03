I was looking at the Nominal GDP of India since 1990…  
  
Try and see if you can find a pattern… all figures are in USD Bn  
  
1991: 77 Bn  
1995: 137 Bn  
2000: 265 Bn  
2005: 425 Bn  
2010: 848 Bn  
2015: 1662 Bn  
2020: 2713 Bn  
  
Not an exact match, but on a thumb rule basis, the GDP is doubling every 5 years…  
  
And if you were to look at most projections of GDP for India, it more or less doubles even in the next 5 years…  
  
Using the rule of 72 to find out the annual rate of growth… 72/5 = 14.4%  
  
India grows at the rate of 14.4% p.a.  
  
Which unsurprisingly, is also the long term CAGR return expected from the Indian stock market…  
  
What’s the CAGR expectation of other countries’ stock market index based on past data?  
  
USA - 10.7% p.a. over the last 30 years  
  
UK - 6.9% p.a. over the past 20 years  
  
China - 13.47% p.a.  
  
So if you’re still thinking of going outside India for more growth… you’re living in the past decade.  
  
This is the time to build, invest and grow in India…  
  
Because no matter what, you cannot fight the market.  
  
Be where the tide is the strongest and the fastest, and that’s in India!
