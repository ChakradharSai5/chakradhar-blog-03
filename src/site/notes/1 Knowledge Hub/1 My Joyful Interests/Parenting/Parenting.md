- Your job as a parent is to make your child socailly acceptable by the age of 4-5, **burn that in to your mind**
- because he should be able to interact with other child and adult and that is how he learns to live

	- I find something likable about a kid that has an opinion.  I appreciate  a kid who knows what they want…or don’t want…and knows how to stand up for what they think is right.  
  
		Children prone to opinions and question often grow up to be great leaders.    
	  
		But when every conversation turns into an argument, it can get frustrating for the parents as well as for the child. When your child wants to argue with you about everything and most likely wants to win every single time, what do they really want?  
		  
		1. Most likely, children who argue or engage in power struggles want to be in control.Consider the bigger picture. During the course of a day, what does your child have control over? Do you decide everything for them? From wake-up time till bedtime? Kids need autonomy and control. Let them have a say in small things.  
		  
		2. It’s also possible that your child has learned this behavior from a parent, friend, neighbour, relative ? If other adults or children are the cause of your child’s bad behavior, limit exposure to the bad role models.  
		  
		3. Children’s fights often start when children see a situation as unfair, are trying to assert what they think is right, feel that others don’t see their perspective, or view the same situation in different ways. It is all about teaching them how to ask for what they want respectfully & politely.  
		  
		4. Let your son or daughter know that arguing with their parents is a habit that really needs to end.  Tell them that even if they believe that they are 💯% right, the issue is one of respect.  
		  
		5. One simple thing that helped me was not to take it personally. Make it a light moment at that time and deal with the underlying issue later. Don’t feel that the child doesn’t respect you, they just need to be heard.  
		  
		6. Let them know the difference between a healthy debate and an argument. It’s ok to disagree and discuss-but it should be healthy and respectful.

Scaring a kid to leave him, if he dosen't listen to come with you leaving a place, From insta post
			-  https://www.instagram.com/p/CrDwjO2Mg35/
		you’re on a walk with your toddler. You need to get dinner on, the baby is screaming, & your toddler is walking backwards while looking for worms, despite asking them to get in the stroller many times. ⁠  
		⁠  
		How many times have we heard (or done) this at the playground?  
		⁠  
		“Ok, I’m leaving!” → toddler still playing, ignoring us →“Okay, I mean it, I’m leaving now” - starts walking away → toddler still plays, looking up from time to time → “Okay BYYYE!” → toddler screams, “NOO!!” And sobs, running towards parent.⁠  
		⁠  
		Leaving the park - or somewhere fun - is TRIGGER-ZONE-CITY for toddlers. They don’t want to leave the park, they feel sad, and they want to STAY. ⁠  
		⁠  
		When we tell our kids “I’m LEAVING, BYE!” we’re accidentally telling them: Your feelings about wanting to stay don’t matter, I’m leaving now, get over it. And, there’s a chance I might leave you for real one day.⁠ This is scary for their little brains.⁠  
		⁠  
		So, let’s make a plan. Your goal is to get them to leave the park (or any fun activity), and here’s how you do it:⁠  
		⁠  
		See them → “You’re having so much fun.”⁠ ⁠  
		  
		OK their feelings → “It’s hard to leave when you’re having fun.”⁠ ⁠  
		  
		Hold the Boundary → “It’s time to go home.”⁠ ⁠  
		  
		Orient towards the fun → Mention a fun thing to do together once home⁠ ⁠  
		⁠  
		The key is: Boundaries. Don’t wait until we’re in full meltdown mode. After the first 2 warnings, confidently hold the boundary by gently removing your toddler and helping them home. It sounds like this: “Leaving IS very hard. I’m going to help you now.”⁠  
		⁠  
		And yes, they may be VERY upset at this boundary. It’s ok for them to be upset. We’re ok with that feeling. ⁠  
		⁠  
		We’re keeping their emotional (and physical) security intact, while showing them that it is time to go home now. No fear involved

- What important three things not to do while parenting
	- https://www.instagram.com/p/CyLcKxnshMI/
	- 1. Saying you're gonna leave them, their biggest fear is abandonment
	- 2. Invalidating their feeling, make them understand that feeling anything is ok, but, acting on it is not, asking them to change their feeling makes them incongruent with their own emotions when they grow up
	- 3. Not letting them choose, let them choose as they want as far as possible

- Things to say to kids
	- When they "I can't do it"
		- you tell them "You can't do it yet"
	- "I keep making mistakes"
		- "Learning from Mistakes help you grow"
	- "It's so hard"
		- "everything is hard, before it get's easy"
	- "I can't get it right"
		- "you are still learning"

- Play "picture yourself " game with Siva
	- as in movie "Leo"

- Sharing about losing is also important too

	For context, Hugh Jackman was sharing how, when anxious, he would just close up, and not share about it with his kids. He never realized before how his kids might think he was upset with them because he never explained to them what he was going through.  
	  
	We often keep our worries to ourselves, but it can make our kids feel confused. What if we opened up more? Shared what’s going on in a way they understand. It doesn’t mean dumping all our problems on them, but letting them know we’re stressed or anxious and it’s not their fault.  
	  
	Because truly, they can sense when something’s off. Being honest builds trust and shows it’s okay to talk about feelings and struggles. Sharing our losses teaches them resilience and that it’s okay to fail—it’s how we get back up that matters.
