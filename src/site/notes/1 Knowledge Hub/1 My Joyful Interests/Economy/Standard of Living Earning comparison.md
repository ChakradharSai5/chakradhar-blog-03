How much should you be earning if you move to the US, UK or UAE to maintain the same standard of living that you have in India?  
  
I have a basic thumb rule called 4-3-2 that I use for a quick calculation... and here’s explaining it.  
  
It’s a well established fact that someone earning USD 100k in the US is not living a lifestyle similar to someone earning Rs 85 Lakhs in India.  
  
The Indian guy would have a much better lifestyle with that money in India because cost of living is substantially lower.  
  
Thus, to equate both currencies across geographies from a cost of living perspective, instead of using the foreign exchange rate for conversion, we use the PPP factor or the Purchasing Power Parity.  
  
👉🏼 For USA, the PPP factor with respect to INR is ~22. This means USD 100k = INR 22L in purchasing power, and not INR 85L  
  
👉🏼 For UK, the PPP factor w.r.t INR is ~35. This means GBP 100k = INR 35L in purchasing power, and not INR 1 crore  
  
👉🏼 For UAE, the PPP value of AED 100k = INR 10L and not INR 23L  
  
👉🏼 So, to get purchasing power equivalent for India, divide your INR forex rate based US salary by 4, UK salary by 3, and UAE salary by 2.  
  
👉🏼 All these countries have different tax rates, so please only compare post tax incomes.  
  
Also know that such PPP indices are built based on the costs for an entire country. Thus, when you take cost of living of specific cities into account, there would be differences... but it’s a general benchmark for the entire economy.  
  
A hammer used to flatten pizza dough may give you the desired result, but may not always be advisable. So, remember this does not take into account the value you ascribe to living close to family, air quality, absolute savings, etc... so use that in your own context. Your life’s priorities are not everyone else’s priorities.
