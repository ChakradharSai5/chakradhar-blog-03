### Processor Notation
- Processor of intel has basically like this
				- EX: i7-1355U
- We have 3 levels of processors, as i3, i5 or i7 as we know that indicates levels of speed of processor
- 1355 - first two digits tells about generation, this is 13th generation, if suppose as 1275H then that is 12th generation
- and last U that means ultra low power processor which is good for saving battery, that is that processor draws very low power and so very low end speed to save for battery
- that U can be H - means High performance processor, gives almost desktop processing speed
- that U can be HX - very High performacne processor, gives proper desktop processing speed

so three things, i3, i5, or i7 , 
then 12xx, or 13xx, or 14xx(currently 14th gen is running in 2024), 
then U, H or HX processor

### Processor Cores
- usually they mention how many cores in that particular processor and among that total, how many are for P and how many are for E is also mentioned.
- P core is performance, if more P core for means good performance & speed Ex: gaming, video editing
	- P core can handle hyperthreading, that is multiple threads at a time
- E core purpose is to save battery, Effieciency core ,by doing things that are less prioriry or less performance deamanding tasks in background, consuming less battery, ex: like indexing, email syncing
	- one thread at a time
- these P & E cores in CPUs - Central processing unit of **General** purpose
- there are other processing unit for specialized purposes like GPU - Grphaiic processing unit, 
- and recently lauched NPU - Nueral processing unit for using AI
##### EXAMPLE: 
Samsung book4 has i7 1355**U** processor, with 10 cores and 12 Threads(Threads are mentioned as Logical processors)
- 2 P cores and 8 E cores, 
comparing with i7 1300**H** processor, comes with 14 cores and 20 Threadds
- 6 P core and 8 E core
> NOTE: 
> 	there is something called Cinebench R23 scores, in that also we have single thread and muliti thread score,
> 	the above mentioned 1355U processor compared with 12th Gen H processsor to show how bad U processor performance is

### Display
- Refresh rate: 60Hz, 120Hz or 144Hz rate you know about it, gives smoothness feel while using 
- Pixel clarity: 720p(HD),1080p(FHD), QHD (2.8k), 4k, 8k - currently my Asus laptop is FHD, most companies offer 1080p, thats just ok, QHD could be far better so that no pixelating can be seen, higher the clarity lower the pixelating can be seen
- Scren size: Laptops: 15.6inch, 16inch, for tablets 11.7inch, or 12 inch- 
### Color gamut
- **color gamut** refers to the range of colors a display can reproduce. Different standards (like **sRGB**, **Adobe RGB**, **P3**, and **NTSC**) define different gamuts or color spaces
- sRGB (Standard RGB)
	- most widely used color space, designed for consistency across different devices like web content, cameras, and printers
	- Ex: **61% sRGB**: This means the display can reproduce only 61% of the colors in the sRGB color space.
- Adobe RGB
	- Adobe RGB is a larger color space compared to sRGB
	- used for tasks requiring a broader range of colors, like **professional photo editing** and **printing**.
	- has more range than DCI P3 in **green-cyan** range
- DCI-P3 (P3 Color Space)
	- P3 is a wider color gamut used in **digital cinema** and **HDR content**
	- has different areas more color compare to Adobe RGB and some color areas less compare to Adobe RGB
	- **DCI-P3** covers more colors in the **red and yellow** spectrum, which makes it preferable for **video** and **cinema**.
- NTSC (National Television Standards Committee)
	- NTSC is an older color space, mainly used in the TV industry.
	- out dated
### Brightness 
- Measured in nits
	- in phones it would be around 2800nits, for laptop around 400nits
### Battery
- measured in Wh, for laptop around 55Wh

### GPU 
- Recently Nvidia RTX 3050 or 4060 8GB VRAM
- 4060 graphics card can easily run1440p or 1600p gaming
-
