### Thaniland
- Khao Sok National Park?  
  
It is considered as the best national park in South Thailand with a beautiful Cheow Lan Lake, the oldest evergreen rainforest in the world, waterfalls, hiking trails, caves and a significant wildlife.  
  
𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻  
Khao Sok is best reached from Phuket, Krabi, Koh Lak or Surat Thani. You can get there by minivan with air conditioning. We went from Surat Thani and the price for one person was 6€. You can book the tickets for minivan on www.bookaway.com or www.12go.asia . We recommend to use bookaway, because they have the same offers but better prices.  
  
𝗩𝗶𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗼𝘄 𝗟𝗮𝗻 𝗟𝗮𝗸𝗲  
The best way how to enjoy Cheow Lan Lake is book a tour with a guide. There are many companies that offer different types of tours depending on the length. We joined tour with [@khao_sok](https://www.instagram.com/khao_sok/) and it was perfect. You can choose between 1,2,3 or 4 days tours and you can also sleep at overwater bungalow and it is absolutely worth it! 😍 Sleep in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by water and cliffs. Amazing experience.

Don’t forget repelent, waterproof shoes, raining coat and sunscreen for you trip.
