The Debrigarh wildlife Sanctuary in Bargarh district becomes the first Ecotourism facility in Odisha to offer Star-gazing, with roofs that have cutouts in them to look up at the night sky.  
  
It also offers telescopes for the visitors to enjoy the view of constellations, planets and stars. The community members have been trained to identify various heavenly bodies so that they can help tourists enjoy the view.  
  
📸All the images are courtesy the Twitter/X handle of Hirakud Wildlife Division.  
  
🏡There are six exclusive cottages designed for this purpose. These cottages are adorned with astro-photographs taken from the sanctuary. Because Debrigarh is a dense forest with no light pollution, you can get a clear view of the night sky.  
  
👍Please share this with others and make a plan to visit the eco-tourism centre. During monsoon, you may not get a clear view of the night sky always, but this place has so many beautiful waterfalls that your trip will still be very enjoyable.  
  
🚙How to go: Debrigarh is near the Hirakud dam, at the end of the right dyke. Drive time from Bhubaneswar will be around 7 hrs with breaks. You can book the stay at www.ecotourodisha.com . The sanctuary is probably the best run in the state with many activities for the visitors. Please follow this page to stay updated.
