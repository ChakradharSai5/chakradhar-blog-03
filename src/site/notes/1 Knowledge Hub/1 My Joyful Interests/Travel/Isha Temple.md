- The most loved part from my isha trip is coincidentally attending the special puja on pournima. The puja takes place by giving arathi at devi and then moving to dyanalingam. I immensely felt peaceful throughout and unknowingly closed my eyes to meditate for few mins. Happy for all of this but still had that missing feeling of not experiencing laser show at adiyogi statue. Therefore I would suggest you guys to stay for atleast 2 days in isha to cover everything. And do not forget to book your rooms in Isha prior to 45 to 60 days if you are planning to visit Isha during Pournima.
