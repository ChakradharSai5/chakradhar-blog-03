- Here very similar to [[1 Knowledge Hub/1 My Joyful Interests/My Conceptual Understandings/Physics Principles and Laws/AC Motor#Synchronous Motor\|AC Motor#Synchronous Motor]] but in reverse, here the rotating rotor will be supplied with DC excitation, and so this will make constant magnetic field if we have a stand still rotor
- when the rotor is forced to rotate, the coils in stator experience a rotating magnetic field, which causes by [[Faraday's Law\|Faraday's Law]], generate and EMF across the voltage
