- People when they say Induction motor, they are talking about AC Motors
- AC motors are mainly classified into:
	1. Induction Motors (Most Common)
    
	2. Synchronous Motors
### Induction Motor
- A typical AC Motor, where 3 Ph AC supply given to Stator, and so a rotating magenetic field is generated, and we place a many looped coil, nothing but a squirrel cage inside it, which causes induced current in that coil, and that induced current as it is currently in presence of Magnetic field, it expereinces [[Lorentz's Law\|Lorentz's Law]] force and so rotates
- Here starting torque would be low compared to steady state torque, as starting requires induction current to build and then after building then experiences Lorentz's force
- Initially due to very nature of coil inductance, it takes time to build the current and to come in sync with stator 3 Ph current
	- Later once it reaches certain current and so rotating at may be with slip of around 3-5%- typical, then the torque will reach a moderate level
### Synchronous Motor
- This is kind of similar to [[1 Knowledge Hub/1 My Joyful Interests/My Conceptual Understandings/Physics Principles and Laws/DC Motor#Brushless\|DC Motor#Brushless]], major difference is here mostly use Electromagnets in Rotor, for Stator instead of using switching circuit as in [[1 Knowledge Hub/1 My Joyful Interests/My Conceptual Understandings/Physics Principles and Laws/DC Motor#Brushless\|DC Motor#Brushless]], here we have inherent current swithcing for RMF as it is 3 Ph AC supply
- Now the thing is for elctromagnet we put coil in rotor and give a DC current, which we call excitation current, 
- And so Unlike induction motors, synchronous motors don't self-start, for starting we need to give an additional DC current
- This is very similar to [[1 Knowledge Hub/1 My Joyful Interests/My Conceptual Understandings/Physics Principles and Laws/Generator\|Generator]]
