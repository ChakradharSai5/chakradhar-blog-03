- Mainly two types of relays:
    - Electro mechanical relays which works like Solenoid valve, which works n faradays principle
    - This is mainly used for controlling high current circuits to lower current circuitss
    - Second type is solid state relays
        - More reliable as no moving parts
        - Smaller circuit throughs a LED
        - And this led light gets to a photo diode which control makes through bigger circuit
        - Making it more complex by numerical relays
