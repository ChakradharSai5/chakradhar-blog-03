- There is something called hydration property of water, what it means is, we think, at least till now I thought ions can't be stable, like any ion like H+ or OH- all these are unstable is what I thought; but today I found out that water has this property called hydration
- basically what it does is any salt say NaCl, dissolves in water, what happens is this NaCl breaks to Na+ and Cl- and this individual ions attracts water's opposite ions like Na+ attracts OH- ions of water, the H2o molecule stays intact, however this Na+ ion imagine like big sphere and that sphere gets sorrunded by multiple H20 molecules with OH- facing Na+, like that some 4-6 molecules sorrounds this Na+ ion and forms what we call hydration shell
- Now the thing this makes it more stable than just Na+ ion without hydration shell, so this makes Na+ less reluctant to react with Cl- and so this this Na+ stays as ion form, and same goes fro Cl- ion, like some 6-8 molecules sorrounds(higher number because size of Cl- is big compared to Na+)
- So this is what makes H+ ions and OH- ions also present in H20 but very minute, in stable equilibrium condition, 55.5 moles of water(whcih is 1 litre of water) has 1 x 10^-7 moles of H+ and so OH- ions, by having hydration shell around them
- example:
	- The negatively charged oxygen atoms of water are attracted to Na⁺, and they surround it in a compact shell. This helps keep Na⁺ stable and prevents it from getting too close to other ions or reacting too strongly.
- This is majorly possible because H2O has dipole property, which lacks in other solvents, other solvents show this but very less like ethanols, some alchohols, but has less of this property compared to H2O
