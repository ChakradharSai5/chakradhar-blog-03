 - The matter is Earth is rotating around sun in elliptical but if you see, it has very small eccentricity so it is almost like circle
 - Also there's a myth saying that during summer Earth is near from Sun and during winter Earth is far from sun, but that's a myth
 - As they say if you see, during januay in america, the earth comes nearest to Sun, hence it is clear that the before point is a myth
 - the logic is simple, Earth by nature it is 23.5 Degrees tilted, so what happens say for example 
	 - At one end of earth northen hemisphere is pointing towards the sun, then what happens is if you see from sun perspective, the north part experiences more light and heat compared to southern part, so though earth rotates and so shall have day and night, overall, compare to south the north part gets more heat, hence summer in north part
	 - Same way, this earth moves revolving around sun and reaches the other end, as the axis stays same way, now the southern bottom part is pointing towards sun, that makes the southern part getting more light and heat, and so the same logic applies as before point and so norhtern part gets winter
- For this same reason we have longer days during summer as that part gets exposed to sun for longer time, you just imagine the first case of northern pole pointing towards sun, there, imagine greenland which shall have all the sun thorugh out day and night and the green land is very near to pole and sun shines to other side of pole which is away from sun also, now if you come down, from green land to equator, line by line latitude, that part of earth gets day time shorter and shorter, the green land has 24Hrs day and from there before getting to [[1 Knowledge Hub/1 My Joyful Interests/Science/Terms#Tropical\|Terms#Tropical]] the length of day gets smaller but higher than normal that is 22 Hrs, 20Hrs, 18Hrs, like that.

### Seasons in India Vs America
- For India,
	- as the Tropic of Cancer passes middle of India, south of this Tropic of Cancer is [[1 Knowledge Hub/1 My Joyful Interests/Science/Terms#Tropical\|Terms#Tropical]] region, and north of this Tropic of Cancer is [[1 Knowledge Hub/1 My Joyful Interests/Science/Terms#Temperate\|Terms#Temperate]].
	- Lies close to the equator (tropical to subtropical climate).
	- Strongly affected by monsoon winds.
	- And so the seasons shall be traditionally three
	- 1. Summer - March to June
	- 2. Monsoon -July to Sept
	- 3. Winter- Oct to Feb![ChatGPT Image Apr 8, 2025, 11_01_24 PM.png](/img/user/Obsidian%20Functional%20Stuff/z-All%20pdfs,%20Images%20&%20Small%20Excalidraws/ChatGPT%20Image%20Apr%208,%202025,%2011_01_24%20PM.png)
- In America
	- As it Spans from temperate to polar zones.
	- Has four clear seasons, especially in the north and central parts.
    1. Spring: Melting snow, new growth (March–May)
    2. Summer: Warm to hot (June–August)
    3. Autumn (Fall): Cooling, leaves fall (Sept–Nov)
    4. Winter: Cold, snow in many areas (Dec–Feb)
