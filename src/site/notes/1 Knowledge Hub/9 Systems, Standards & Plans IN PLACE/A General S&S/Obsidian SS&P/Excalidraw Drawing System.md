### The Problem
- So the problem is that, any Excalidraw drawing I do here in obsidian is well and good, however as GitHub digital garden thing that I am using cannot process this Excalidraw as drawing and so will show in blog as some code, so what I want is I want an easy and simple way to create and excalidraw file in here at obsidian, but when I go to blog I want to see that as an image
### The solution
- The solution is there is an option in Excalidraw plugin, where when you create an Excalidraw file, it automatically creates SVG file, then and there, beside the the Excalidraw file you created, so what you do is, 
1. you create a file about the topic, as usual say "Topic A"
2. Then you create this Excalidraw file with name "Topic A Drawing" just beside "Topic A",(*so this Drawing is the standard name suffix for Excalidraw files*), so when you create this latter one, there gets creates an SVG File of same name, beside this
3. Now, in this "Topic A" file you call the "Topic A Drawing" SVF file as SVG file like this : "![Topic A Drawing]", this makes the SVG  file come as a image & at bottom you call the original page like [[Topic A Drawing\|Topic A Drawing]] 
4. Now you move this "Topic A Drawing" file to "z-All pdfs, Images and Small Excalidraws ", along with that SVG file also moves and so the original one place looks unclutter
So, whenever you access this Topic A in blog, it will show image, so no issue (no need of rendering), however in obsidian when you access this and want to edit this Topic A, you click on bottom link and open the original Excalidraw page and edit in that
