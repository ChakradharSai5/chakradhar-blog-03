You know I have 100GB google photos drive storage plan, to make best of use of this 100GB, and have a simple, clean memory photos, we need to have offline and online storage of photos and videos

So this plan is devised for that, now you see this plan is made in such a way to satisfy this following things
1. Any photos whether in offline or online, should be non-redundant, as life's goal is not to live in memories, they are not suppose to capture every moment, we should keep in mind to live in present, only then just by seeing even a single moment of photo shall give reminiscence of past, and also, it encourages us to look at world with only mindset of present-live not to live for create memories for future, because memories are the things that happen, we can't plan them
2. There will be a offline folder with naming convention our usual standard "YYYY-MM-DD text_of_context", this helps sorting, here DD is optional, this format I am using everywhere, the same goes for albums naming in google photos
3. Every album shall have both videos and photos, what we do is we will delete all unwanted photos and videos first, and then, in the after keeping all relevant photos and videos, what we do is, we make an album as required, with naming convention as shown in third point
4. Now, after making all this, for each album, we do two things
	1. We first, download all photos and videos, each album one by one, and then, after downloading, name that album name same to this folder, this shall be kept in separate folder where we will mention they have all full size photos and videos with full clarity
	2. Then, in that particular online album we see and delete videos, that take huge space, mostly videos.
	3. **NOTE**: Note that, after this exercise, photos and videos shall be in both offline and online, in offline we shall have full range of photos and videos, whereas in online we shall have videos only that take less space and not so frequently watched
