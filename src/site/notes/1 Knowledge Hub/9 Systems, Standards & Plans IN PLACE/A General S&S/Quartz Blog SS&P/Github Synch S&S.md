About Github:
- well, it is owned by Microsoft and allows a maximum of 100GB storage for codes, related documents, images and facilities
- but recommends about 1GB usage
- as we have few pdfs and many images and that too small size, so I don't think it would cross more than 1GB

 So think my Approach would be 
        - to write and embed all pdfs and images completely offline, and simply sync them to repository for web access and sync them with syncthing for phone and tablet access
        - what this does is 
            1. this will have all pdfs and images to repository and can be accessed with no issue, except for some minor css issue that can be taken care of with time
            2. as this shall create exact vault inside phone and tablet, it shall take a good amount of space in phone & tablet, which if less than 1 GB, I guess, is absolutely fine.
            3. Point to note that, sometimes if a note requires a drawing to be shown in middle, what we will do is we create a excalidraw file along with all pdfs and images folder and SVG file of that particular file shall be embedded in this note file, (SVG file gets created automatically with )
    NOTE: it may be noted that, the pdfs and images MIGHT or MIGHT NOT be from google drive/one drive/or any other local/cloud storages I have and google photos or some other, this vault shall have duplicated copy of that - that is this vault shall NOT be accesing the file from that cloud through iframe link, this shall ensure simplicity in and removes clumsiness.
