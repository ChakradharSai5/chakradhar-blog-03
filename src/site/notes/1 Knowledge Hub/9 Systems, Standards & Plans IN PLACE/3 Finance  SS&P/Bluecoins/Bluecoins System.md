### Bluecoins Synch System
It works in three levels
1. When you do Quick Synch - while close open or when you manually press quick synch - it shall modify a single file in 
	- Google drive---->Bluecoins Folder----->Quicksynch ---> Blucoins.fydb
	- and there's another tracker file, along with fydb file to store meta data I think
2. Another from this local backup is set at daily 0000Hr to folder
	- Internal storage---->Bluecoins--->Backups folder
3. Apart from this, if you press "back up to Google drive" in "Online Synch" options in bluecoins setting then a fresh back up file shall gets created inside bluecoins folder of Google drive (Beside Quick synch folder)
### Approach to understand Home Finances from Bluecoins
- In phone the approach would be like
	- There's a tab called **Budget**, which is to see Monthly Essentials & Monthly Income with budget planned percentage
### Bluecoins Account & Categories system
- There shall be no transactions to other, except the tallying needs, so for any report the budget/spending analysis statements shall be taken without others category
