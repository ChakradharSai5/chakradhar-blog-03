- CW duct charging down one side from CW blow down I think Hot CW duct, ICV 1 and ICV 2 CW cold duct charging
    - Now Pass-B Inlt and O/L valves slightly opened to 40%

### CW Duct

- CW inlet duct draining gets over by starting itself in may be 1 day
- CW outlet duct draining done takes about 6 days
##### For CW Duct Filling, after completion of overhauling
- CW outlet duct that is going to CT Fans, both unit-1 and Unit-2 's shall be side by side at FWPH, and here we have a blow down valve one valve from each duct forms a header, if both valves is made open, running unit CW hot duct water shall fill OH unit's duct, takes about 1 complete night or some more
- This shall fill water up to out let valves of CW Pass at condenser
- Then for CW Inlet duct, ICV shall be made crack open, say for unit-2, ICV-2 shall be made crack open water shall fill in CW inlet duct up to CW inlet valve
- I think while charging water box, ARV at condensor above shall lift, and this causes water spill from ARV, only then it is ensured ball got lifted in ARV and sit right in the place locking, ARV works only with water, as air escapes through ARV with ball not getting lifted, only water makes it lift up and so shall close the path - works as automatic Vent valve
- After this duct charging, CLCW and DMCW shall be lined up for PHE with proper venting, then all the TG and SG side cooling water lines are charged
### Random

â€¢ TD-B cartridge is going to get replaced

- Main TG barring gets stopped roughly on 6thday
- While aligning rotor JOP will be started and stopped and rotor rotated slowly by aux barring motor and alignment will be done
- Bearing 2 has speed probes, I think 3 seen while overhauling
### Random learnings

- Before start of overhauling
    - All welding DB, and AC MLDB switchgear OH PTW will be taken by EMD, as same cannot be done during overhauling
        - There is something
    - Also insulation survey will be done by I think EEMD, (not sure), to identify in boiler where insulation required.
    - TDBFPs solo run will be done while stopping the unit
