# Experience of [[1 Knowledge Hub/2 Functional Notes/1 Career Notes/3 TSTPS Kaniha Technical Notes/A Protection Interlocks and Control Logic Systems/CLCS/Main TG\|Main TG]] rolling trip
before TG rolling, what happened is just we reset the turbine, but as soon as turbine got reset, CV got opened along with SV

and so turbine got rolled to very high speed, so immediately tripped the turbine by pressing EPB

Ashok sir was there from Cni to roll, and I did the reset and at that time I did not know that it is such a thing that turbine sholudnâ€™t roll at all, i thought it will roll to some speed and then trip.

but speed went very high as seen by ashok, so he shouted to trip turbine , i tripped by pressing the EPB.
