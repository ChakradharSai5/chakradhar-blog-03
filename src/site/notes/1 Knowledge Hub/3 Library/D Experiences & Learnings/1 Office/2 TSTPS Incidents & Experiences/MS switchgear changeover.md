- In miscellaneous switchgear, we did changeover of source of MS-A bus and MS-B bus, from incomer of MS-A & MS-B respectively to MS-C tie incomer
- most of incomer breakers found not working, from local control board for trip and close of breaker, so what we did is trip and close from hand lever on the module, - which is kind of dangerous
