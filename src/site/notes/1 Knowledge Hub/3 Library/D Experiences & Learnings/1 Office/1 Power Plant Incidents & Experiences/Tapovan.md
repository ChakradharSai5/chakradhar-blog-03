### Tapovan Incident
In February 2021, a catastrophic flash flood occurred in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, India, impacting the NTPC Tapovan Vishnugad hydroelectric project. The disaster was triggered by a massive rock and ice avalanche, which led to a deluge of water and debris rushing through the Rishiganga and Dhauliganga river valleys. This sudden surge caused extensive damage to infrastructure, including the Tapovan project, and resulted in significant loss of life.

Rescue operations were launched to save workers trapped in the project's tunnels. One such tunnel, approximately 2.5 kilometers in length, became the focal point of these efforts. Rescuers faced immense challenges due to the accumulation of debris and sludge, which hampered progress. Despite relentless efforts over several days, the operation was fraught with difficulties, and the chances of finding survivors diminished over time.

The incident underscored the vulnerabilities of infrastructure projects in ecologically sensitive and geologically unstable regions. It prompted discussions on the environmental impact of large-scale constructions in the Himalayas and the need for stringent safety and environmental assessments to prevent such tragedies in the future.

In a related context, concerns have been raised about the NTPC Tapovan Vishnugad project's tunnel in connection with land subsidence issues in Joshimath. NTPC clarified that the tunnel is approximately 1.1 kilometers away from the outer boundary of Joshimath town and about 1.1 kilometers below ground level, asserting that the project has no role in the region's subsidence.
