### Google Deep Mind on AI

-  Google DeepMind recently launched AlphaFold3, a significant advancement in protein structure prediction. It builds on AlphaFold2, which revolutionized biology by accurately predicting protein 3D structures. AlphaFold3 goes further by predicting how proteins interact with other biomolecules like DNA, RNA, and small molecules, making it a powerful tool for drug discovery and disease research. 
- This AI-driven model enhances our understanding of cellular mechanisms and could accelerate breakthroughs in medicine, biotechnology, and synthetic biology. Its accuracy and speed outperform previous methods, making it a game-changer in structural biology. AlphaFold's contributions earned the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
