- I have not seen it, and I doubt if I ever get time to properly watch it
- but recent video  I have seen in YT made me think about it
- Here protagnaist as you know breaks the fouth wall many times, but the thing, this isn't a choice made create fun for audience, also deep inside out protagaist feels alone, and don't allow anyone to enter her zone, so she does that
- but at the end of season, she finally lets' somebody in, then she asks audicene to not follow her
- What  I really like, is, not just this, also in [[1 Knowledge Hub/3 Library/C Movies/Loki series\|Loki series]], though our hero deals with asuch a big thing, or having fun or whatever they are doign, they are all doing for purpose and that is human deep insecure or humane things that every one want, like not to be lonely in [[1 Knowledge Hub/3 Library/C Movies/Flea Bag\|Flea Bag]], like wanting friends to be with him in [[1 Knowledge Hub/3 Library/C Movies/Loki series\|Loki series]]
